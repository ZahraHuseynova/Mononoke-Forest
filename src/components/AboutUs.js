                        Rest your eye on something beautiful.<br/>
                        Touch something alive.<br/>
                        Find a moment of stillness, of quiet contemplation.<br/>
                        Let nature bring out the best in you.<br/>

                    The Sill was founded on the premise that plants make people happy.

                    <p>
                    There’s something in the simple act of being around, and caring for, plants that boosts<br/>
                    our spirits and enhances our environments.It’s actually been established that every <br/>
                    exposure to nature—from gardening to forest bathing to just sharing space with organic <br/>
                    elements—mitigates the modern condition, that stressed-out state we find ourselves in all too often.<br/>
                    </p>
                    <p>So we offer new ways to infuse this restorative beauty into as many everyday rituals as<br/> 
                        possible, through biophilic design that increases your connection to the natural world. <br/>
                        It will ground you, fortify you and light you up.
                    </p>
                    <p>Join us in cultivating a life well-lived.</p>

                        <p>Eliza Blank founded The Sill in 2012. Passionate about plants, she wanted to help demystify them, make them accessible to non-horticulturists and elevate the experience beyond the local garden supply center. </p>
                        <p>She broke new ground with an online plant delivery business that has grown to include stores in New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston. Hands-on educational workshops are now hosted in-store and online, and the brand vision has expanded beyond plants to include biophilic design that evokes an essential connection to the natural world.</p>
                        <p>As Eliza says, “Plants create time and space to nurture yourself. If you’re not making time for them, you’re probably not making time for yourself either.” </p>
                        <p>The Sill is here to help you connect to plants and nature, so you can cultivate a life well-lived.</p>
